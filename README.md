# GAN

This Repo Implements several GANs architectures to play with in PyTorch

## Classifier GAN

Assessing mode dropping of gans by training a Auxiliary classifier GAN (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09585.pdf), and then training a Classifier with generated labeled data. Assessing mode dropping with the accuracy of the classifier on a test set.

## CycleGAN

Pytorch Implementation of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf
